Allowed functions : None

• Create a function that swaps the value of two integers whose addresses are entered

as parameters.

• Here’s how it should be prototyped :

void ft_swap(int *a, int *b);

Here's the implementation of the `ft_swap` function that swaps the values of two integers using their addresses:

```c

void ft_swap(int *a, int *b) {

    int temp = *a;

    *a = *b;

    *b = temp;

}

```

In this function, `a` and `b` are pointers to integers representing the addresses of two integer variables. To swap the values of these variables, we use a temporary variable `temp` to store the value of `*a` (the value at the address pointed by `a`). Then, we assign the value of `*b` to `*a`, and finally assign the value of `temp` to `*b`. As a result, the values of the two integers are swapped.

You can include this code in the `ft_swap.c` file and compile it with your program to test the `ft_swap` function. Remember to include any necessary headers and a main function to test the code.
