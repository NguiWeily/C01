Files to turn in : ft_ft.c

Allowed functions : None

• Create a function that takes a pointer to int as a parameter, and sets the value "42"

to that int.

• Here’s how it should be prototyped :

void ft_ft(int *nbr);

Here's the implementation of the `ft_ft` function that sets the value of an integer to 42 using a pointer:

```c

void ft_ft(int *nbr) {

    *nbr = 42;

}

```

In this function, `nbr` is a pointer to an integer. By dereferencing the pointer using the `*` operator, we can access the actual integer variable it points to. Assigning the value 42 to `*nbr` updates the value of the integer variable passed to the function.

You can include this code in the `ft_ft.c` file and compile it with your program to test the `ft_ft` function. Remember to include any necessary headers and a main function to test the code.
