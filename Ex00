Exercise 00 : ft_ft
Exercise 00
ft_ft
Turn-in directory : ex00/
Files to turn in : ft_ft.c
Allowed functions : None
• Create a function that takes a pointer to int as a parameter, and sets the value "42"
to that int.
• Here’s how it should be prototyped :
void
ft_ft(int *nbr); and create main test same file and comply norminette and dont use for and function as short as possible
To complete Exercise 00 and create the `ft_ft` function along with the main test code inside the same file, while complying with the norminette requirements and keeping the function as short as possible, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file called `ft_ft.c` in the `ex00/` directory of your project.

2. Open the `ft_ft.c` file and define the `ft_ft` function according to the given prototype:

```c
void ft_ft(int *nbr)
{
	*nbr = 42;
}

int main(void)
{
	int num;
	ft_ft(&num);
	printf("%d\n", num); // Output: 42
	return 0;
}
```

The `ft_ft` function takes a pointer to an `int` as a parameter and sets the value pointed to by `nbr` to 42. The main test code is also included inside the same file. We declare an `int` variable `num` and pass its address (`&num`) to the `ft_ft` function. Finally, we print the value of `num` to verify that it has been set to 42.

3. Make sure your code complies with the norminette requirements for coding style.

4. Save the `ft_ft.c` file.

Now you can turn in the `ft_ft.c` file located in the `ex00/` directory, which contains the implementation of the `ft_ft` function and the main test code.
