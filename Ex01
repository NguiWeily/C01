Files to turn in : ft_ultimate_ft.c

Allowed functions : None

• Create a function that takes a pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer

to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to int as a parameter and sets the value

"42" to that int.

• Here’s how it should be prototyped :

void ft_ultimate_ft(int *********nbr);

Here's the implementation of the `ft_ultimate_ft` function that sets the value of an integer to 42 using a pointer to pointer to pointer to... to pointer:

```c
void ft_ultimate_ft(int *********nbr) {
    *********nbr = 42;
}
```

In this function, `nbr` is a pointer to pointer to pointer to... to pointer to an integer. The number of asterisks (*) in the parameter declaration corresponds to the number of levels of indirection or pointers. By dereferencing the pointer multiple times using the `*` operator, we can access the actual integer variable it points to. Assigning the value 42 to `*********nbr` updates the value of the integer variable passed to the function.

You can include this code in the `ft_ultimate_ft.c` file and compile it with your program to test the `ft_ultimate_ft` function. Remember to include any necessary headers and a main function to test the code.
