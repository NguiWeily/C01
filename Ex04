Allowed functions : None

• Create a function ft_ultimate_div_mod with the following prototype :

void ft_ultimate_div_mod(int *a, int *b);

• This function divides parameters a by b. The result of this division is stored in the

int pointed by a. The remainder of the division is stored in the int pointed by b.

Here's the implementation of the `ft_ultimate_div_mod` function that performs division on two integers and stores the results in the provided pointers:

```c

void ft_ultimate_div_mod(int *a, int *b) {

    int temp = *a; // Store the value of a

    *a = temp / *b; // Perform division and update the value of a

    *b = temp % *b; // Calculate remainder and update the value of b

}

```

In this function, `a` and `b` are pointers to integers representing the addresses of two integer variables. The value of `*a` (the value at the address pointed by `a`) is stored in a temporary variable `temp`. Then, we perform the division `temp / *b` and store the result in `*a`, updating the value of `a` with the division result. Lastly, we calculate the remainder `temp % *b` and store it in `*b`, updating the value of `b` with the remainder.

You can include this code in the `ft_ultimate_div_mod.c` file and compile it with your program to test the `ft_ultimate_div_mod` function. Remember to include any necessary headers and a main function to test the code.
