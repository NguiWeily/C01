Files to turn in : ft_strlen.c

Allowed functions : None

• Create a function that counts and returns the number of characters in a string.

• Here’s how it should be prototyped :

int ft_strlen(char *str);

Here's the implementation of the `ft_strlen` function that counts and returns the number of characters in a string:

```c

int ft_strlen(char *str) {

    int count = 0;

    while (str[count] != '\0') {

        count++;

    }

    return count;

}

```

In this function, `str` is a pointer to the character array (string) for which we want to count the characters. We initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of characters. We iterate over the characters in the string using a `while` loop and increment `count` for each character until we reach the null terminator `'\0'` that marks the end of the string.

Finally, we return the value of `count`, which represents the number of characters in the string.

You can include this code in the `ft_strlen.c` file and compile it with your program. Remember to include a main function to test the `ft_strlen` function.
