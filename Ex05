Files to turn in : ft_putstr.c

Allowed functions : write

• Create a function that displays a string of characters on the standard output.

• Here’s how it should be prototyped :

void ft_putstr(char *str);

Here's the implementation of the `ft_putstr` function that displays a string of characters on the standard output:

```c
#include <unistd.h> // Include the necessary header for the write function

void ft_putstr(char *str) {
    int i = 0;

    while (str[i] != '\0') { // Loop until the end of the string
        write(1, &str[i], 1); // Write each character to the standard output
        i++;
    }
}
```

In this function, `str` is a pointer to the character array (string) that we want to display. We iterate over the characters in the string using a `while` loop and write each character to the standard output using the `write` function from the `<unistd.h>` header. The third argument of `write` is set to 1 to indicate that we want to write one character at a time.

You can include this code in the `ft_putstr.c` file and compile it with your program. Remember to include the `<unistd.h>` header and a main function to test the `ft_putstr` function.
